# HospitalAppointments
#### The analysis will be taken from **Kaggel** NoShowAppointments dataset; it's about a hospital in Brazil. The project assumes it's a private hospital and aims to investigate the patient attitude and look for what's the factors affecting the patient whether they show up or not in the hospital, and this investigation will end up with findings that will help the hospital to increase the number of patients showing up and this will lead to increase the profit of the hospital.
#### The libraries included in the project (numpy,pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.pyplot).

## The project motivation
#### My motivation is to write code about a real business case in life like this project for patients and hospitals and try to apply it here for example in my country. Besides learning the error and mistakes in the Jupyter Notebook.

##### - The Show patients without receiving SMS are higher than Show patients with receiving SMS.
##### - The neighborhood does have effects on patients showing up.

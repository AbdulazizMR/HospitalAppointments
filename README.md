# HospitalAppointments
## Introduction:
#### The analysis will be taken from **Kaggel** NoShowAppointments dataset; it's about a hospital in Brazil. The project assumes it's a private hospital and aims to investigate the patient attitude and look for what's the factors affecting the patient whether they show up or not in the hospital, and this investigation will end up with findings that will help the hospital to increase the number of patients showing up and this will lead to increase the profit of the hospital.

## Libraries used:
#### • numpy
#### • pandas
#### • matplotlib

## The project motivation:
#### My motivation is to develop a practical coding project based on a real-life business case, such as this project involving patients and hospitals, and apply it to a similar context in my country. Additionally, I view working with Jupyter Notebook as an opportunity to gain insights from the errors and mistakes encountered, facilitating continuous learning and improvement.

## Summary:
#### • Most patients aged between 0-7 years.

#### • The Show patients without receiving SMS are higher than Show patients with receiving SMS!

#### • The neighborhood does have an effect on the number of patients.

#### • Most of the patient's gender attend appointments females more than males.
